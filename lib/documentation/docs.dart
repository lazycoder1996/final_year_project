List<String> levelling = [
  'Levelling is a process of determining the height of '
      'one point level relative to another. It is used in surveying to establish the elevation'
      ' of a point relative to a datum, or to establish a point at a given elevation relative to a datum. '
];
List<String> traversing = [
  'A traverse consists of a series of straight lines connected'
      'successively at established points, along the route of survey. The points defini'
      'ng the ends of the traverse line are called traverse station or traverse points. '
      'Distance (horizontal distance) between traverse stations are known as traverse '
      'side which are measured by using a tape or electronic measuring equipment. '
      'Traversing is the traditional surveying method which is used to determine plane '
      'coordinates (rectangular coordinates) of established traverse stations. '
      'A traverse is currently the most common of several possible methods for establi'
      'shing a series or network of monuments with known positions on the ground. Such '
      'monuments are referred to as horizontal control points and collectively, they '
      'comprise the horizontal control for the project. This method is employed to es'
      'tablish horizontal control, the result is to assign rectangular coordinates to'
      'each control point within the survey. This allows each point to be related to'
      ' every other point with respect to distance and direction, as well as to permi'
      't areas to be calculated when needed. '
      'The purpose of a traverse is to determine the horizontal location of natural or '
      'artificial objects and topographic detail points on the ground to prepare plans '
      'or maps with contour lines. To determine the location of points of which horizontal '
      'positions are unknown by the help of other points of which positions are known by'
      'making necessary observations between traverse stations and traverse sides.'

List<String> typesOfLevelling = [
  'Simple Levelling\n'
      'It\'s the simplest operation in levelling when it\'s necessary to locate the '
      'difference in elevation between two points, each of which is visible from a '
      'single position of the level. '
      'The readings can be obtained on a staff held successively upon these points. '
      'The precise situation of the level is immaterial, but to eliminate the instrumen'
      'tal error, the sight distances to the two staff positions should be kept as near'
      'ly equal as possible. '
      'The level is set on a firm ground anywhere, not necessarily in the same vertical'
      ' plane as that of the two staff positions.',
  'Precise Levelling\n'
      'This is the operation of levelling in which precise instruments are used. In pr'
      'inciple, there is no difference between simple and precise leveling. In the for'
      'mer, the distances between checkpoints are relatively short, and the elevations'
      ' obtained are satisfactory for routine purposes. '
      'However, for precise levelling, the level loop may be of substantial length, and '
      'efforts are made to control all the sources of errors. '
      'The most important error control in precise levelling is the balancing of foresig'
      'ht and backsight distances. Precise levelling is similar to differential levelling'
      'but in this case higher precise is wanted. To achieve high precise, serious observa'
      'tion procedure is performed. The accuracy of 1 mm per 1 km is achieved. '

List<String> typesOfTraversing = [
  'Closed Loop Traverse\n'
      'This type of traverse creates a closed geometrical shape (polygon). A closed traver'
      'se is one that either begins and ends at the same point. Therefore the angles '
      'can be closed geometrically and the position closure can be determined mathem'
      'atically. Traverse surveying in the field yields observed angles or directions '
      'and length of the traverse sides. Thus, these parameters are used in traverse '
      'computations which are performed in a plane rectangular coordinate system.',
  'Closed Link Traverse\n'
      'A link traverse is connected to at least two points, at the beginning and at '
      'the end of traverses ,whose coordinates have been previously determined. Calc'
      'ulations can be made to check for errors.After the balancing the traverse angles,'
      ' the next step in closed link traverse computation is calculation of either az'
      'imuths. Azimuths are calculated by using balanced (adjusted) traverse.'
