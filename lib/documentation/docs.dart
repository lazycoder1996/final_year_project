  'Levelling is a process of determining the height of '

List<String> traversing = [
  'A traverse consists of a series of straight lines connected'
      'successively at established points, along the route of survey. The points defini'
      'ng the ends of the traverse line are called traverse station or traverse points.'
      'Distance (horizontal distance) between traverse stations are known as traverse '
      'side which are measured by using a tape or electronic measuring equipment. '
      'Traversing is the traditional surveying method which is used to determine plane '
      'coordinates (rectangular coordinates) of established traverse stations. '
      'A traverse is currently the most common of several possible methods for establi'
      'shing a series or network of monuments with known positions on the ground. Such'
      'monuments are referred to as horizontal control points and collectively, they '
      'comprise the horizontal control for the project. This method is employed to es'
      'tablish horizontal control, the result is to assign rectangular coordinates to'
      'each control point within the survey. This allows each point to be related to'
      ' every other point with respect to distance and direction, as well as to permi'
      't areas to be calculated when needed.'
      'The purpose of a traverse is to determine the horizontal location of natural or '
      'artificial objects and topographic detail points on the ground to prepare plans '
      'or maps with contour lines. To determine the location of points of which horizontal'
      'positions are unknown by the help of other points of which positions are known by'
      'making necessary observations between traverse stations and traverse sides.'
